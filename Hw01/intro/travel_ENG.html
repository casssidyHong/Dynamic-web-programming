                    This was my third visit to Osaka, but it was my first time experiencing snow, feeding seagulls, and even eagles. I ventured to the picturesque town of Ine, 
                    famous for its traditional boathouses lining the waterfront. The serenity of the place, coupled with the gentle falling snow, made it feel like I had stepped 
                    into a postcard. I also visited Uji, the birthplace of matcha, where I savored the rich flavor of authentic matcha tea at a traditional tea house. The subtle 
                    bitterness and smooth texture were unforgettable, and being in the heart of matcha’s origins made the experience even more special.

                    During this trip, I also explored parts of Osaka I hadn’t before, such as the quieter, lesser-known neighborhoods that offered a glimpse into the everyday 
                    lives of the locals. Wandering through small alleys, I stumbled upon cozy cafes and unique shops, each with its own charm. It felt as if I was rediscovering 
                    the city with fresh eyes, appreciating its blend of old and new.

                    This was my second time visiting Korea and Seoul, but unlike my previous guided tour, this time I opted for a free-and-easy trip. Without the restrictions of a set itinerary, 
                    I had the freedom to explore the city at my own pace and truly immerse myself in its vibrant culture. I started my adventure by visiting the bustling neighborhoods of Hongdae and Itaewon, 
                    where I wandered through hip cafes, quirky boutiques, and lively street performances. It was refreshing to be able to linger wherever I wanted, taking in the local vibe and discovering 
                    hidden gems along the way.

                    One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the historic Bukchon Hanok Village. Strolling through the narrow alleys lined with traditional hanok houses, I felt transported back in time. 
                    The peaceful atmosphere, contrasted by the modern skyscrapers in the distance, perfectly captured the unique blend of tradition and modernity that defines Seoul.

            <div><img src="travel_im/vietnam.jpg" alt="VIETNAM">
                <p>This was my first time visiting Vietnam, and I decided to take on the challenge of a self-guided trip. Luckily, most of the attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are close to one another, 
                    so I managed to explore the main spots in just a few days. However, my excitement took a turn when I tried the local specialty, egg coffee. Unfortunately, it led to food poisoning, 
                    leaving me bedridden in the hotel for several days. While it wasn’t the ending I had hoped for, it was certainly an unforgettable experience—one that taught me to be a bit more 
                    cautious when trying unfamiliar foods!

                    This was one of my favorite travel experiences abroad. The marine ecosystem of Bohol Island is exceptionally well-preserved, offering a glimpse into an underwater paradise. 
                    The crystal-clear waters allow you to see vibrant coral reefs teeming with colorful fish and other marine life. I was thrilled to swim alongside graceful sea turtles, 
                    watch massive schools of sardines create mesmerizing patterns, and even encounter the majestic whale sharks up close. Each moment felt surreal, and the experience of being 
                    so close to these creatures in their natural habitat was something I’ll cherish forever. It’s truly a haven for nature lovers and an unforgettable destination for snorkeling 
                    and diving enthusiasts.

                    Despite having limited time, I made the most of my trip to Hong Kong by visiting key attractions. On the first day, I went to Victoria Peak for breathtaking views of the skyline and harbor, 
                    which were even more stunning at sunset. The next day, I explored the lively districts of Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui, indulging in egg waffles and milk tea while browsing street vendors and shops.
                     I also visited Harbor City Mall for a bit of shopping. On my final day, I slowed down and visited Man Mo Temple, enjoying its tranquil atmosphere. Before leaving, I took a peaceful walk along the 
                     waterfront promenade, reflecting on this brief but unforgettable trip.
