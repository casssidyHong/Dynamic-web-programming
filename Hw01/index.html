            <h1>Major</h1>
            <p>My major is computer science, a field that emphasizes continuous learning and practice in programming throughout the entire four years of university. 
                From fundamental concepts in the early stages to advanced topics later on, we are constantly building and refining our coding skills. 
                Whether it's learning new languages, understanding algorithms, or working on large-scale projects, programming remains at the core of our studies, 
                preparing us for a rapidly evolving tech industry.

            <h1>Cross-Disciplinary Program</h1>
            <p>Due to my strong interest in Electronic Engineering, I applied for the Cross-Disciplinary Program for a double major during my freshman year. 
                The field of Electronic Engineering has always fascinated me with its focus on the design and development of electronic systems, from circuits 
                to complex integrated systems that power modern devices.
            </p>
            <p>At the university, the Electronic Engineering department offers a diverse curriculum that spans foundational topics such as circuit theory, 
                electromagnetics, and semiconductor devices, to more advanced subjects like microelectronics, signal processing, and communication systems. 
                Students are not only trained in theoretical knowledge but are also given practical experience through hands-on labs and projects. 
                This combination of theory and practice is what drew me to pursue a cross-disciplinary program, as I believe the skills gained from both Computer Science 
                and Electronic Engineering will complement each other and prepare me for future challenges in technology and innovation.
