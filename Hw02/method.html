                Traverse through the numbers as a string and use a custom function to insert each number into a sorted string.<br>
                After inserting all numbers into the sorted string, find the middle two numbers and calculate their average.<br>
                If the number of elements is odd, take the middle number directly.<br>
                If the number of elements is even, average the two middle numbers.
            </td>
            <td>
                For input "3,1,4,2,8,6,7,5",<br>
                - Insert each number to get sorted string: "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8".<br>
                - For an even number of elements, the median is calculated as (4+5)/2 = 4.5.<br>
                - So, the median is "4.5" (as a string).
